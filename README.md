   **Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
    The DriverPass project involved creating a server-based client app for a company wishing to provide its users with easily accessible driving instruction. DriverPass wanted an online application that would integrate with its brick-and-mortar offices, allowing users to maintain an online profile, access learning materials, and book appointments through the app.
   
   **What did you do particularly well?**
    This is always a difficult question to answer, especially in the context of not having the time to devote to creating the project as completely as I would have wished to. However, I feel that my initial breakdown of the client's needs was particularly effective.
    
**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
    I would choose to revisit my work on the class diagrams, in order to create a detailed method and member structure.
    
**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
    I was able to take the original interview, together with my own research into similar services, and create a fairly good idea of what the users needed. It is critical when designing systems that the user's requirements be documented as completely as possible within the initial stages of design. Failure to do so frequently results in systems having to be rebuilt at the last minute in order to accomodate an unplanned-for need.
    
**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
Designing software is something like an adventure every time. I would say that this outlook is both my greatest strength, and my worst weakness. I shy away from using a strictly outlined approach, but sometimes I take the concept too far and proceed without a plan at all. In the future, I need to find a balance between planning ahead and allowing myself the flexibility to adapt as I go along
